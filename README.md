# Sets in Python

## Objectives

After completing this section, you will be able to:

- Work with sets in Python, including operations and logic operations
- Understand set uniqueness and basic operations
- Perform set logic operations like intersection, union, and difference

## Set Content

A **set** is a unique collection of objects in Python. You can denote a set with a pair of curly brackets `{}`. Python will automatically remove duplicate items:

```python
# Create a set
set1 = {"pop", "rock", "soul", "hard rock", "rock", "R&B", "rock", "disco"}
print(set1)
```

### Convert a list to a set

```python
album_list = [
    "Michael Jackson", "Thriller", 1982, "00:42:19",
    "Pop, Rock, R&B", 46.0, 65, "30-Nov-82", None, 10.0
]

album_set = set(album_list)
print(album_set)
```

### Add Elements

```python
# Add element to set
A.add("NSYNC")
print(A)

# Try to add duplicate element
A.add("NSYNC")
print(A)
```

### Remove Elements

```python
# Remove the element from set
A.remove("NSYNC")
print(A)
```

### Membership Test

```python
# Verify if the element is in the set
print("AC/DC" in A)
```

## Sets Logic Operations

You can check for difference, symmetric difference, intersection, and union between sets.

```python
# Define two sets
album_set1 = set(["Thriller", "AC/DC", "Back in Black"])
album_set2 = set(["AC/DC", "Back in Black", "The Dark Side of the Moon"])
```

### Intersection

```python
# Find the intersections
intersection = album_set1 & album_set2
print(intersection)

# Or use the method
print(album_set1.intersection(album_set2))
```

### Differences

```python
# Find the difference in set1 but not set2
print(album_set1.difference(album_set2))

# Find the difference in set2 but not set1
print(album_set2.difference(album_set1))
```

### Union

```python
# Find the union of two sets
album_set3 = album_set1.union(album_set2)
print(album_set3)
```

### Subset and Superset

You can check if a set is a superset or subset of another:

```python
# Check if album_set1 is a superset of album_set2
print(album_set1.issuperset(album_set2))

# Check if album_set2 is a subset of album_set1
print(album_set2.issubset(album_set1))

# More examples
print(set({"Back in Black", "AC/DC"}).issubset(album_set1))
print(album_set1.issuperset({"Back in Black", "AC/DC"}))
```

## ðŸ§  Quiz on Sets

Try these on your own:

1. **What happens when you convert a list with duplicates to a set?**
   - Hint: Think about how sets handle uniqueness.

2. **What is the result of `set1 & set2` vs `set1 | set2`?**
   - Tip: One is intersection, the other is union. What do they return?

3. **How does Python treat membership in sets (`in` keyword)?**
   - Consider performance and how it differs from lists.

4. **When is a set a subset or superset of another?**
   - Use `.issubset()` and `.issuperset()` methods or comparison operators like `<=` and `>=`.

# Loops in Python

## Objectives

By the end of this section, you'll know how to use the loop statements in Python, including `for` loop and `while` loop.

## Range

Sometimes, you might want to repeat a given operation many times. Repeated executions like this are performed by **loops**. We will look at two types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.

Before we discuss loops, let's discuss the `range` object. It is helpful to think of the `range` object as an ordered list.

## For Loops

### Basic For Loop Example

```python
dates = [1982, 1980, 1973]
N = len(dates)

for i in range(N):
    print(dates[i])
```

The code in the indent is executed N times. Each time, the value of i is increased by 1 for every execution.

### Print sequence from 0 to 7

```python
for i in range(0, 8):
    print(i)
```

### Loop directly through a list

```python
dates = [1982, 1980, 1973]

for year in dates:  
    print(year)
```

For each iteration, the value of the variable year behaves like the value of dates[i] in the first example.

### Use for loop to change the elements in a list

```python
squares = ['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'purple', 'blue']

for i in range(0, 5):
    print("Before square", i, 'is', squares[i])
    squares[i] = 'white'
    print("After square", i, 'is', squares[i])
```

### Loop through the list and iterate on both index and element value

```python
squares = ['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'purple', 'blue']

for i, square in enumerate(squares):
    print(i, square)
```

## While Loops

As you can see, the for loop is used for a controlled flow of repetition. However, what if we don't know when we want to stop the loop? What if we want to keep executing a code block until a certain condition is met?

The while loop exists as a tool for repeated execution based on a condition. The code block will keep being executed until the given logical condition returns False.

### While Loop Example

```python
dates = [1982, 1980, 1973, 2000]

i = 0
year = dates[0]

while(year != 1973):    
    print(year)
    i = i + 1
    year = dates[i]

print("It took", i, "repetitions to get out of loop.")
```

A while loop iterates until the condition in the argument is not met, as shown in the example above.

# Functions in Python

## Objectives

After completing this section, you will be able to:

- Understand what functions are and how to create them
- Work with function parameters and return values
- Understand variable scope (local vs global)
- Use built-in functions effectively

## What is a Function?

A function is a reusable block of code which performs operations specified in the function. They let you break down tasks and allow you to reuse your code in different programs.

There are two types of functions:

- **Pre-defined functions** (built-in)
- **User defined functions**

### Function Definition Rules

Here are simple rules to define a function in Python:

- Functions blocks begin with `def` followed by the function name and parentheses `()`
- Input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses
- There is a body within every function that starts with a colon `:` and is indented
- You can place documentation before the body
- The `return` statement exits a function, optionally passing back a value

### Basic Function Example

```python
# First function example: Add 1 to a and store as b
def add(a):
    """
    add 1 to a
    """
    b = a + 1
    print(a, "if you add one", b)
    return(b)

# Call the function add()
add(1)
add(2)
```

### Function with Multiple Parameters

```python
# Define a function for multiplying two numbers
def Mult(a, b):
    c = a * b
    return(c)
    print('This is not printed')  # This line never executes
    
result = Mult(12, 2)
print(result)
```

### Functions with Different Data Types

```python
# Use mult() multiply two integers
Mult(2, 3)

# Use mult() multiply two floats
Mult(10.0, 3.14)

# Use mult() multiply string and integer
Mult(2, "The BodyGuard ")
```

## Variables and Scope

The input to a function is called a **formal parameter**.

- A variable that is declared inside a function is called a **local variable**
- A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a **global variable**

```python
# Function Definition
def square(a):
    # Local variable b
    b = 1
    c = a * a + b
    print(a, "if you square + 1", c) 
    return(c)

# Global variable
x = 3
# Makes function call and return function a y
y = square(x)
```

## Pre-defined Functions

There are many pre-defined functions in Python:

```python
# Build-in function print()
album_ratings = [10.0, 8.5, 9.5, 7.0, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 9.5] 
print(album_ratings)

# Use sum() to add every element in a list or tuple together
sum(album_ratings)

# Show the length of the list or tuple
len(album_ratings)
```

## Using if/else Statements and Loops in Functions

```python
# Function example
def type_of_album(album, year_released):
    print(album, year_released)
    if year_released > 1980:
        return "Modern"
    else:
        return "Oldie"
    
x = type_of_album("The BodyGuard", 1980)
print(x)
```

### Print the list using for loop

```python
def PrintList(the_list):
    for element in the_list:
        print(element)

# Implement the printlist function
PrintList(['1', 1, 'the man', "abc"])
```

## Setting Default Argument Values

```python
# Example for setting param with default value
def isGoodRating(rating=4): 
    if(rating < 7):
        print("this album sucks it's rating is", rating)
    else:
        print("this album is good its rating is", rating)

# Test the value with default value and with input
isGoodRating()
isGoodRating(10)
```

## Global vs Local Variables

```python
# Example of global variable
album = "The BodyGuard"

def printer1(album):
    internal_var1 = "Thriller"
    print(album, "is an album")
    
printer1(album)

# Example of global variable and local variable with the same name
myFavouriteBand = "AC/DC"

def getBandRating(bandname):
    myFavouriteBand = "Deep Purple"  # Local variable
    if bandname == myFavouriteBand:
        return 10.0
    else:
        return 0.0

print("AC/DC's rating is:", getBandRating("AC/DC"))
print("Deep Purple's rating is:", getBandRating("Deep Purple"))
print("My favourite band is:", myFavouriteBand)  # Global variable
```

## Collections and Functions

When the number of arguments are unknown for a function, they can all be packed into a tuple:

```python
def printAll(*args):  # All the arguments are 'packed' into args
    print("No of arguments:", len(args)) 
    for argument in args:
        print(argument)

# printAll with 3 arguments
printAll('Horsefeather', 'Adonis', 'Bone')

# printAll with 4 arguments
printAll('Sidecar', 'Long Island', 'Mudslide', 'Carriage')
```

Similarly, the arguments can also be packed into a dictionary:

```python
def printDictionary(**args):
    for key in args:
        print(key + " : " + args[key])

printDictionary(Country='Canada', Province='Ontario', City='Toronto')
```

## Quiz on Functions

1. **Come up with a function that divides the first input by the second input:**

```python
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b
```

2. **Write a function to find total count of word "little" in the given string:**

```python
def count_little(text):
    words = text.lower().split()
    return words.count('little')

# Test string
test_string = "Mary had a little lamb Little lamb, little lamb Mary had a little lamb.Its fleece was white as snow And everywhere that Mary went Mary went, Mary went Everywhere that Mary went The lamb was sure to go"

print(count_little(test_string))
```

## Summary

This guide covered three fundamental Python concepts:

1. **Sets**: Unique collections with operations like union, intersection, and difference
2. **Loops**: For loops and while loops for repetitive operations
3. **Functions**: Reusable code blocks with parameters, return values, and scope considerations

Practice these concepts to build a strong foundation in Python programming!
